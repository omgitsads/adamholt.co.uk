title: Beginning With CouchDB
published: false
---

Recently i've been spending a lot of time learning about NoSQL databases, initially i chose to experiment with MongoDB over CouchDB, this was for a few reasons: 

* Map/Reduce scared the crap out of me
* MongoDB's ability to do dynamic queries if felt a bit closer to what i know in SQL-land
* A talk at Scottish Ruby Conf meant to promote CouchDB put me off.

However, i have come back to look at CouchDB in detail and i'm wishing i hadn't put it off for so long, in short, i'm loving it. I want to take you through the things i have learnt about CouchDB so far.

## Getting Started

Im only going to take you through the very basics of setup on OSX with homebrew, there are plenty of linux instructions around the web. Google is your friend.



    {% highlight bash %}
    brew install couchdb
    {% endhighlight %}
